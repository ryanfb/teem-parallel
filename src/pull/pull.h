******** pullInfo enum
**
** all the things that might be learned via gage from some kind, that
** can be used to control particle dynamics.
**
** There are multiple scalars (and associated) derivatives that can
** be used for dynamics:
** - Inside: just for nudging things to stay inside a mask
** - Height: value for computer-vision-y features of ridges, valleys,
**   and edges.  Setting pullInfoHeight as a constraint does valley
**   sampling (flip the sign to get ridges), based on Tangent1, Tangent2,
**   and TangentMode.  Setting pullInfoHeightLaplacian as a constraint
*    does zero-crossing edge detection.
** - Isovalue: just for implicit surfaces f=0
** - Strength: some measure of feature strength, with the assumption
**   that it can't be analytically differentiated in space or scale.
